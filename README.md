Welcome to the world of Valebat!

Valebat is a top-down 2D fantasy RPG, primarily a player vs. enemy (PvE) dungeon-style game, and will support cooperative 2-player multiplayer.

The core of the game is its elemental magic system, featuring type advantages, elemental combinations and other gameplay elements. Players can buff spells of a particular element type by collecting elemental essence dropped by enemies, allowing them to level up elemental spells and unlock multi-elemental spells which are more powerful and have additional effects.
