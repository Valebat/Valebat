# Valebat
Your princess got kidnapped by an evil mage! You, a wizard apprentice, have to scale a magical tower, discover spells, and level up in order to save your princess! Each playthrough is guaranteed to allow you to have a different experience!

Welcome to the world of Valebat!

Valebar is a top-down 2D fantasy RPG. Valebat is a player vs. enemy (PvE) dungeon-style game, and supports both single-player and cooperative 2-player multiplayer.

The core of Valebat is its elemental magic system, featuring type advantages, elemental combinations and other gameplay elements. Valebat also comprises features such as level-specific objectives and random map generation to make each playthrough a uniquely fun experience!

In order to attract new gamers to play our game, we will have a general cute theme like that of Postknight and MapleStory.
